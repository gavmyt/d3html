    <p>
    Chapter 5 discusses D3 as a way to visualize data and breaks down it's various components and how each of them are used. There are a few different commands used in D3.
    </p>
    <p>
    The select command is one of the first ones used. select() allows you to pick out a specific element to modify in the DOM whether it is body, p, h1, or something else.
    </p>
    <p>
    The append command { append () } creates the new DOM element and puts it inside the element being modified based off of the select command. As an example, you can append a new paragraph inside of the body, if the body is what is being referenced in the select command
    </p>
    <p>
    The text command inserts a string of text into the DOM. It inserts this string based off of whatever is selected based off the other code.
    </p>
    <p>
    The style command is able to make cosmetic changes to the DOM. But with the use of functions, this cosmetic data can actually make certain data easier to understand. You can set up a function to make the data a certain color (or another element) if the data reaches a specific point or threshold. This makes the data more interactive and gives a visual cue to to what is going on and allows the reader to more easily interpret said data.
